# Tic-Tac-Toe

  * Tic Tac Toe Game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

  * Games played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to Ancient Egypt, where such game boards have been found on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BC.
  An early variation of Tic-Tac-Toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC.

User Experience (UX)
---

 * By encouraging logical thinking, Tic Tac Toe helps children develop there spatial skills. This skill is important for their problem solving abilities-from everday simple chores to complex mathematical equations besides from a simple game of Tic Tac Toe, children can also develop their spatial abilities by playing around commercial playground equipment.

 * Another good intellectual quality of Tic Tac Toe is that it’s a game with rules. According to Fromberg & Bergen in the their book "Play from birth to twelve" (2012), children playing games with rules can help in their intellectual, sociomoral, and personality development. This helps develop an advanced interpersonal understanding which result to better negotiation of conflicts with other children. They recommend that these educational games with rules be a vital part of children’s early education.

**More To Add**

 * I would like to add more games and extra pages that help children develop various skills, research shows playing puzzle style games can improve children’s abilities to plan, organize, get along with others, and regulate emotions. in addition, play helps with language, math and social skills, and even helps children cope with stress.
