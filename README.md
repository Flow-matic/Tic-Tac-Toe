# Tic-Tac-Toe

### Tic Tac Toe Game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

### Games played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to Ancient Egypt, where such game boards have been found on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BC.
### An early variation of Tic-Tac-Toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC.
